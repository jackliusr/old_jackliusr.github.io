Measuring volume

* Many chemical reactions involve liquids, solutions or gases.
* some common apparatus used to measure the volume of a gas, a solution or a liquid in a chemical reactions.
* Gas: gas syringe, it is used to *collect gases of any density*.
* Liquid:
* Meniscus is the *surface of the liquid that curves at the side* of the measuring intrument. To get an accurate volume reading, it must be read from the lowest or the highest level of the meniscus. *The surface of the liquid may curve upwards or downwards depending on the type of liquids.
