Measuring volume

* Many chemical reactions involve liquids, solutions or gases.
* some common apparatus used to measure the volume of a gas, a solution or a liquid in a chemical reactions.
* Gas: gas syringe, it is used to *collect gases of any density*.
* Liquid:
+

* it has an accuracy to 0.1 cm^2^
* used to measure the volume of a solution accurately.

|pipette

* used to deliver an accurate fixed volume of a solution.
* There are different pipettes designed to deliver different fixed volumes of solutions, such as 20 cm^3^, 25 cm^3^ or 50cm^3^

|measuring cylinder
|it measures an approximate amount of volume of a solution.

|beaker
| it measures an approximate amount of a solution.

* Meniscus is the *surface of the liquid that curves at the side* of the measuring intrument. To get an accurate volume reading, it must be read from the lowest or the highest level of the meniscus. *The surface of the liquid may curve upwards or downwards depending on the type of liquids*.



== Collection of Gases

=== Methods for collecting gases

Gases can be collected by the following methods

* Displacement of air
* Displacement of water
* Gas syringes

====  Displacement of air

* Used to collect gases of *densities higher or lower than air*. it is not suitable for collecting a gas with a density same as air.
* The air in a test tube will be displaced by the gas to be collected.
* Two type of displacement of air
** Downward delivery
** Upward delivery

==== Downward delivery
* used to collect a gas which is *more dense than air*

* The test tube or collecting apparatus is placed at the *upright* position. The gas produced *sinks down* into a test tube and displaces the air inside it.
